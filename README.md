# Jack's Udagram Image Filtering Microservice

### Setup Node Environment

1. Initialize a new project: `npm i`
2. run the development server with `npm run dev`

### Deploying your system

Follow the process described in the course to `eb init` a new application and `eb create` a new environment to deploy your image-filter service! Don't forget you can use `eb deploy` to push changes.

## Stand Out (Optional)

### Refactor the course RESTapi

If you're feeling up to it, refactor the course RESTapi to make a request to your newly provisioned image server.
